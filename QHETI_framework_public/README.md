## 2. Approach
A key distinction is made between retraining and fine-tuning:

1. **Source Modeling:** The base MobileNetV2 model (pretrained on ImageNet) is **retrained** using QHETI images derived from all patient data. This step captures general patterns associated with asthma risk.

2. **Individual Modeling:** The source models are then **fine-tuned** on each individualâ€™s patient data. This personalization step aims to improve prediction accuracy for each patient.

3. **Feature Extraction & Evaluation:** Fine-tuned individual models are converted into **feature extractors** by removing their final classification layers. Patient data is processed to generate penultimate layer outputs, which are then used as features for classical machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-NN, Naive Bayes, and SVM. This ensemble approach leverages multiple algorithms to enhance predictive performance.


## 3. Dataset & Feature Overview

### Original Patient Dataset (30 Features)
```python
quadrant_features = {
    "Q1": [],  # Personal
    "Q2": [],  # Indoor
    "Q3": [],  # Outdoor
    "Q4": []  # Weather
  }
```

### New Patient Dataset (26 features)
```python
quadrant_features = {
    "Q1": [],  # Personal
    "Q2": [],  # Indoor
    "Q3": [],  # Outdoor
    "Q4": []  # Weather
}
```
